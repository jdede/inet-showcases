## Goals

Routing protocols for mobile adhoc networks (MANETs) often fall into two major categories: reactive and proactive. INET contains various routing protocols for manets from both categories.

This showcase demonstrates three manet routing protocols with three example simulations. There is a simulation demonstrating manet routing with a reactive protocol (Aodv), a proactive protocol (Dsdv), and a manet routing protocol that is neither reactive nor proactive (Gpsr).

TODO: it demonstrates how to configure it ?

## About MANETs

manets are mobile so there is no infrastructure and it is dynamic so we need protocols that can
work in the environment. reaction time and scalability.

<pre>

About manets and routing protocols in general
About the three routing protocols briefly
Then about the configuration and networks
Then the results

then the statistic results ? or thats for later
