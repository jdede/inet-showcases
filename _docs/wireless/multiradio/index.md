## Goals

In reality, devices often have more than one wireless interface (for example, a dual band wireless router has two radios.) Wireless nodes in INET can have multiple interfaces as well.
This showcase contains an example simulation, in which nodes communicate via a router, which has two wireless interfaces.

INET version: `4.0`<br>
Source files location: <a href="https://github.com/inet-framework/inet-showcases/tree/master/wireless/infrastructure" target="_blank">`inet/showcases/wireless/infrastructure`</a>

## The model

<!--
- by default, most hosts in INET have just one radio
- but the number of radios can be set by a parameter
- actually, you can build any kind of host with any number of radios
- but it is easy by setting the numWlanIntefaces parameter
- i think even StandardHost has one
- it is part of the LinkLayerNodeBase
-->

<!--
INET's wireless host types have one wlan interface by default.
The number of wlan interfaces in a host is specified by the host's `numWlanInterfaces` parameter. The parameter's default value is 1 for wireless hosts, such as `WirelessHost` and `AdhocHost`, and 0 for `StandardHost`.
-->

The number of wlan interfaces in INET's host types is specified by the host's `numWlanInterfaces` parameter. The parameter's default value is 1 for wireless hosts, such as `WirelessHost` and `AdhocHost`, and 0 for `StandardHost`. (`numWlanInterfaces` is actually the parameter of `LinkLayerNodeBase`, on which these host types are built.) <!--However, one can specify a custom host type with arbitrary number of radio interfaces in the NED file.-->
However, one can build a custom host type from scratch with an arbitrary number of radio interfaces in the NED file.

### The configuration

The example simulation for this showcase uses the following network:

<img class="screen" style="max-width: 90%;" src="network.png">

The network contains two `WirelessHost`s named `host1` and `host2`, two `accessPoint`s (`accessPoint1` and `accessPoint2`), and a `Router`.
The network also contains an `Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`, an `Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium` and an `IntegratedVisualizer` module.

- TODO: using 802.11
- the router has two radios operating on different channels
- the hosts are configured to ping each other
- the scenario is that each host uses a different channel
- each host connects to one of the access points
- the access points are connected to the router...one of the radios of the router
- actually, the router connects to each access point with each of its radios
- the managementtype is set to simplified
- the routes are configured
- the visualizers are configured -> is this needed?
-->

The access points are configured to create wireless networks on different channels. Each host is configured to associate with the nearby access point. The router will have two wireless interfaces, and will connect to both access points with one of its interfaces. The router will connect the two wireless networks by relaying packets between them. `host1` will ping `host2`.

<!--
The two access points will create wireless networks on different channels. `host1` will be associated with `accessPoint1`, and `host2` with `accessPoint2`. The router will connect to both networks, using one of its radio interfaces for each network. `host1` is configured to ping `host2`. The ping packets will go through the router.
-->

<!--
All nodes are configured to use simplifies management modules, thus all hosts are assumed to be already connected to the wireless network at the start of the simulation.
-->

`accessPoint1` is configured to create the wireless network on channel 0, and `accessPoint2` on channel 1.
`host1` is configured to be connected to `accessPoint1`, and `host2` to `accessPoint2`.
The number of radios in `router` is set to two, and each radio is configured to connect to one of the wireless networks. <!--TODO: the access point mac address and the channel needs to be set because of the simplified management-->

<!--
Because of the simplified management, the MAC addresses of the access points need to be set in hosts' management modules in order for them to be associated with the specified access point.--> The following keys from the ini file shows the configuration of the wireless networks:

<p><pre class="include" src="../../wireless/multiradio/omnetpp.ini" from="access point" until="application level"></pre></p>

Setting the `numChannels` parameter is essential for the station nodes, because it tells the management module the number of channels to scan, starting for channel 0. We're using two channels here, 0 and 1.
Since we're using two channels (0 and 1), the stations wouldn't find the wireless network on channel 1 if the `numChannels` parameter were left at its default setting, 1.

<!-- <a srcfile="wireless/multiradio/omnetpp.ini"/> -->

<!--TODO: visualizer config ? -> or just at the results section-->

<!--
the router acts as a gateway between the two wireless networks
host one has a route: for all destinations, the router should be the gateway
so host1 wants to send a packet to host2, the gateway is the router
which is connected to the same accesspoint
-->

Routing is set up by the `Ipv4NetworkConfigurator` module. The routing tables of both hosts are configured to use one of the router's interfaces as gateway for reaching all destinations. The routing table of the router is configured to use its appropriate interface for reaching each wireless network.
<!--TODO: is this needed? doesn't seem useful-->

The routes are shown on the following image. Note that the routing arrows don't go through the access points because they are only L2 devices, but the packets will go through them.

## Results

`host1` is pinging `host2` through the accessPoints and the router in the following video. Successful transmissions between nodes' data link layers are visualized. The transmissions for the two different networks are colored differently (red for AP1 and blue for AP2.)
