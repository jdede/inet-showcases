## Goals

IEEE 802.15.4 is a widely used standard for wireless sensor networks (WSNs.) INET has support for simulating various IEEE 802.15.4 physical and MAC layers. This showcase demonstrates the available IEEE 802.15.4 models available in INET. It contains one/two example simulation/s which feature wireless sensor networks.

INET version: `4.0`<br>

## The model

- about ieee 802154 modes, topology, fdds and rdds
- about the inet implementation
- the scenario
- the configuration

IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard that defines the physical layer and MAC layer of low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). LR-WPANs are low power, low throughput communication networks, which can be used for creating wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet-of-things applications, etc.
A brief overview of the standard follows.

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines multiple physical layer specifications (PHYs), based on different modulations, such as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS), Ultra-wideband (UWB). It defines a CSMA-CA or ALOHA MAC protocol as well. Frequency bands, topologies, fdd's and rdd's...
