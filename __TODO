- Ieee80211LevelOfDetail: packet level: Implicit chunk serialization is disabled to prevent unpredictable performance degradation (you may consider changing the Chunk::enableImplicitChunkSerialization flag or passing the PF_ALLOW_SERIALIZATION flag to peek) -- in module (inet::ieee80211::Rx) Ieee80211LevelofDetailShowcase.host[0].wlan[0].mac.rx (id=60), at t=0.374724514587s, event #15
- Ieee80211LevelOfDetail: bit level when out of communication range: The calculated data field length = 4032 is greater then the actual bitvector length = 1392 -- in module (inet::physicallayer::Ieee80211OFDMRadio) Ieee80211LevelofDetailShowcase.host[0].wlan[0].
- Sensornetwork: BMacLayer config: error (commit ed4a131 ("sensornetwork", 2017-11-15)): Received frame from upper layer while already transmitting. -- in module (inet::physicallayer::APSKRadio) SensorNetworkShowcase.sensor3.wlan[0].radio (id=169), at t=0.067889492153s, event #27
- Sensornetwork: same error in LMacLayer config
- Netmask routes default metric should be higher than the metric of routes added by the configurator ? need some sensible default
- End-to-end-delay: needs byte-tags in the packet API. Fragmentation and packet timestamps are conflicting
- Crosstalk: partially overlapping config: channels 1-2 doesn't cause interference between packets being transmitted at the same time
- Advanced: number of UDP packets are not visualized anymore
- Ieee80211Visualizer doesn't work with simplified mgmt
- RadioMedium: When signal power is 0, the medium shouldn't send the signal (for example when behind a wall + simple obstacle loss)
- PcapRecorder: The timestamp in the pcap file (in wireshark) is not the same as the timestamp in the GUI
- Ieee80211Visualizer should indicate channel number
